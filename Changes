    - Enable difflet_is_deeply when run tests by prove
      (HIROSE Masaaki)

    - Override Test::More::is_deeply when use with "qw(is_deeply)"

      I want to use difflet_is_deeply as is_deeply personally so I added
      '''--exec "perl -Ilib -MTest::Difflet=is_deeply"''' to my ~/.proverc
      but no effect.

    - fix the problem when execute test file with prove
      When we execute the test file with prove, we've got an error message.

      <<Can't locate object method "is_deeply" via package "Test::Builder">>

      I simply replaced the call $builder->is_deeply() with is_deeply().
